# innernette

Inspired by the Innernette of the Tim and Eric awesome show, I decided to build my own Innernette, with it's own search engine and websites. I've designed it so that custom URLs can be added to the search.js file and can be linked to websites in the website folder. If you use this, just remember to add an entry to the search.js for every new entry after adding the new website into the "websites" folder.

Because what's more pointless than an innernette that can be accessed through the internet?
